    1. Preheat your oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Place the squash, cumin and crumbled chilli on to a baking tray. Drizzle with olive oil, mix together and place in the preheated oven. Roast for 45 minutes until the squash is cooked through.
    2. Once the squash is roasted, heat a large saucepan and pour in a splash of oil. Add the celery, garlic, parsley stalks and two-thirds of the onion, and cook gently with a lid on until softened. Drop in the roasted squash and let it sweat for a few minutes, then pour in the stock. Bring to the boil, turn down the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the chickpeas and simmer for 15 minutes more.
    3. mix together the lemon zest, chopped parsley leaves and mint leaves. Chop the remaining onion until itâ€™s really fine, then mix into the zesty mixture.
    4. Season the soup well and, using a hand-held blender, whiz for a few seconds so it thickens, but there are still some chunky bits.
    5. Add the zesty mixture just before serving.
