    chopped_tomato: 1 can
    tomato_puree: 2 tbsp
    mixed_herbs: 1 tsp

method:
    1. Deseeded and thinly slice the red pepper. Peel the carrot and cut into small dice. Halve and peel the onion, then finely chop. Thickly slice the mushrooms.
    2. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the onion and carrots and cook over the heat, stirring frequently, for about 10 mins until the onion is soft. Add the pepper and mushrooms, then stir-fry for a few mins more.
    3. Tip the tomatoes into the pan with half a can of water, the herbs, ketchup and stock, then stir well to make a sauce.
    4. Stir the Quorn into the sauce, season with salt and pepper, then cover and simmer for 12 mins until the vegetables are cooked and the mixture is saucy rather than wet.
    5. Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Add the spaghetti and boil according to pack instructions – usually about 9-10 mins – until just tender.
    6. Drain the spaghetti and pile into bowls. Spoon the sauce on top, then generously grate over the cheese.
