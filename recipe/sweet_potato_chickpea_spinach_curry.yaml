    6. Reduce the heat to a simmer, then cover and cook for 10 to 15 minutes.
    7. Remove the lid, then cook for a further 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the sweet potato is cooked through and the sauce thickened.
    8. Stir in the coconut milk and cook for a couple of minutes, then stir in the spinach and cook until wilted.
    9. Scatter over the coriander leaves, then serve with poppadoms and rice, if you like.
