    1. Peel the onion, cut it in half and stud it with the cloves, then put it in a pan with the milk, bay leaf and a twist of black pepper. Bring to the boil, then take off the heat. Add the bread, cover and leave to infuse for at least an hour.
    2. Finish the sauce shortly before serving - fish out the onion, cloves and bay leaf and stir over a low heat until simmering gently. Simmer for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat, and stir in the pieces of butter, adjust the seasoning and serve hot, on the table in a sauce boat.
