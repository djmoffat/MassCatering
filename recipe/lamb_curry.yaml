    0. Finely chop the onion, dice the peppers
    1. Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan over a high heat. Add the onions and cook for 10–15 minutes, until starting to turn dark golden. (Add a splash of the stock if they start to catch.)
    2. Add the cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the ground spices, along with a big pinch of salt and pepper to taste, and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
    3. Pour in the stock and tomatoes and bring to a gentle simmer. Add the lamb and stir. Cover and cook over a low heat for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    4. Add the peppers to the curry, turn up the heat and cook for 10–15 minutes with the lid off, until the pepper are slightly softened and the sauce is reduced.
